in a quiet village, in a quiet village, nestled by a winding river, nestled by a winding river,  
there lived an old man, an old man who was known for his stories, stories that echoed through the valleys.  
every evening, every evening, children gathered around him, around him to listen,  
to listen to tales of magic, tales of magic and adventure. his words, his words wove worlds,  
worlds of heroes and villains, heroes and villains who danced in the flames of the fire.  
the children’s eyes, the children’s eyes sparkled with wonder, with wonder as they journeyed,  
journeyed through distant lands, distant lands of mystery and enchantment.  
one night, one night, he spoke of a lost kingdom, a lost kingdom hidden beyond the mountains,  
mountains that touched the sky, the sky where stars whispered secrets, secrets of the past.  
his voice, his voice grew soft, grew soft as he spoke of the guardian, the guardian of the kingdom,  
a creature of light, of light and shadow, shadow that moved with the wind, with the wind that carried whispers,  
whispers of destiny. as the flames flickered, flickered in the night, the night grew colder,  
and the old man’s voice faded, faded into the darkness, the darkness that held stories,  
stories yet to be told, to be told in the quiet village, the quiet village by the winding river.
